Web-Based Text Encryption Tool üîêThis project delivers a functional, single-page web application for encrypting, hashing, and decrypting text. It was developed as an assignment and demonstrates proficiency in both client-side and server-side cryptographic implementation and secure key management.üöÄ Live Demo & Repository LinkView Code: https://github.com/Muhammad-Hamza-Nawaz/web-encryptionDemo Video Link: (Paste the link to your unlisted YouTube/Google Drive video here)‚ú® Key Features & Assignment StatusThe application meets all core requirements and successfully implements multiple optional advanced features for bonus marks.Requirement CategoryFeature ImplementedImplementation DetailStatusCore Algorithms (Min 3)Caesar Cipher (Shift: 3)Implemented purely in Client-Side JavaScript (public/script.js).METAES-256-CBCStrong, reversible encryption using the Node.js crypto module.METSHA-256 HashingIrreversible hashing function for integrity checks/password storage.MET & BonusCore UI/ValidationFull UI (Input, Dropdown, Output)Single HTML page (index.html).METInput ValidationPrevents empty text and unselected algorithms (Client-side).METBonus FeaturesDecryptionDedicated /api/decrypt endpoint using the original Key and IV.BonusSecure Key HandlingServer generates unique Key/IV for AES, displayed to the user for decryption.BonusCopy CiphertextButton to easily copy results to the clipboard.Bonusüíª Technical ArchitectureThe application uses a hybrid structure optimized for security and performance:Frontend (UI and Simple Logic):HTML/CSS: Handles layout and styling.JavaScript: Manages user interaction, validation, and the local Caesar Cipher operation. It uses the modern fetch API to communicate with the Node.js backend for all complex crypto tasks.Backend (Security and Complex Crypto):Node.js / Express: Runs the server and defines the API endpoints (/api/encrypt, /api/decrypt, /api/hash).Native crypto Module: The core encryption uses the native Node.js crypto module (preferable over third-party libraries for server security) with the secure createCipheriv function.Key Management Workflow (AES-256-CBC):For AES, the application follows a robust key management process:User inputs plaintext and selects AES.The client sends the plaintext to the server.The server generates a fresh, random 32-byte Key and a 16-byte IV (Initialization Vector).The server returns the Ciphertext, Key, and IV.The client automatically stores the Key and IV in the "Secrets Storage" fields, allowing the user to subsequently decrypt the message.üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation GuideTo run this application locally, you will need Node.js and npm installed.1. Clone the RepositoryOpen your terminal or command prompt:# Clone the repository (if you didn't do it already)
git clone YOUR_HTTPS_LINK_HERE
cd web-encryption-tool
(Remember to replace YOUR_HTTPS_LINK_HERE with your actual repository URL before pushing this final version of the README.)2. Install DependenciesInstall the required Node.js packages (express and body-parser):npm install
3. Start the ServerLaunch the application:node server.js
4. Access the ApplicationOpen your web browser and navigate to:http://localhost:3000
(The server must be running in the terminal while you use the application.)
